This directory contains the necessary files to do a initial simulation for MgO
for a variety of different properties.

There are two scripts:
- runsimulation.sh, runs the simulations by setting correct environmental
        variables and running the python script.  buckingham_pareto.py

       exports the PYTHONPATH using a relative path to the pyflamestk module
- cleanup.sh, removes the results of the previous simulation

There is one python script
- buckingham_pareto.py, which requires the pyflamestk module

There are several configuration files:
- pyposmat.config, contains configuration of the python script 
         buckingham_pareto.
- pyposmat.qoi, contains configuration of material properties
- pyposmat.potential, contains configuration information for the buckingham 
         potential

TO RUN SIMULATIONS:
- all previous existing simulations should be deleted, this package has some
limited ability to recover previous simulations but it isn't robust at this
time, the script cleanup.sh should cleanup results from previous simulations
