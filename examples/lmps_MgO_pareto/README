This directory contains the necessary files to do a initial simulation for MgO
for a variety of different properties.

There are two scripts:
- runsimulation.sh, runs the simulations by setting correct environmental
        variables and running the python script.  buckingham_pareto.py

       exports the PYTHONPATH using a relative path to the pyflamestk module
- cleanup.sh, removes the results of the previous simulation

There is one python script
- buckingham_pareto.py, which requires the pyflamestk module

There are several configuration files:
- pyposmat.config, contains configuration of the python script 
         buckingham_pareto.
- pyposmat.qoi, contains configuration of material properties
- pyposmat.potential, contains configuration information for the buckingham 
         potential
